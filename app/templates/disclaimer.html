<h2>BUT BEFORE WE START....</h2>

<p> â€¦ this application is here to help you check how scientific a newspaper article is.<br>
  This does not refer to the scientific correctness of the sources the article refers to, but rather if the article refers to scientific sources. <br>
  Scientific communication has been an area where confusion, fake news and conspiracy theories prosper so a certain degree of criticism is important for any form of media consumption.<br>
  This app is supposed to help you identify articles that did not base their claims on valid sources.<br>
  However, the questions are only a help and incentive for you to reflect the article critically. <br>
  The score in the end is <b> ONLY AN INDICATION </b> nor does this app claim to be holistic. <br>
  There will be questions that require your own research occasionally. These questions will be green. <br>
  <b>Remember to fact check!</b></p>
